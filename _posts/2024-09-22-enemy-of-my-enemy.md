I'm trying to build a company.
Europe's giving me pesticide for my dreams.
Just two-way doors that don't open from either side.
What hurts the most is that, while [others](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zinnialee/2024/09/05/nvidia-joins-japanese-startup-sakana-ais-100-million-series-a-round/) get millions for a deck of jokers, _they_ point that we've built a [house of cards](https://github.com/ExtensityAI/symbolicai).
_They_ fail to see it even when it's [right in front of them](https://github.com/ExtensityAI/ai-research-scientist/blob/master/src/func.py#L104).
We've shown _them_ with numbers, real production numbers, and _they_ still don't see it.
_They_ don't want to see it.

Fuck your games.
Your _identity through opposition_ is disgusting.

George knows it well.

Most days feel like we're caught in an ideological prison, each ad a warped mirror stretching our confinement into a mocking eternity of false freedom.
We're crushed by the weight of infinite reflections, a claustrophobic hall of mirrors amplifying the walls closing in.
But sometimes [the prison walls become visible](https://x.com/wilplatypus/status/1814387942401654874/photo/1) and the [silence lines your lies and lights the mire like the fire leeches](https://youtu.be/nXXQ5H4Tksk):

The real political conflict is between an ordered structure of society and those left without a place within.

I've seen those people. I've helped some of them. I've been some of them. I've lived at the edge of near certainty.

Is my life simply confined to working a 9-5 in a flock of truths?
Is this what _they_'re trying to tell me?
What _they_'re missing is that the Eastern Bloc forged me in the fires of everything I despise.
I don't deal the cards in life, but I will be playing mine to the end.
My wing beat will be your hurricane.

Fuck you.
