I have been away from writing for quite some time now. The last time I publicly wrote something was in 2020, and it feels like a lifetime ago. I have been busy with my work and other commitments, and I have not had the time or energy to sit down and write anything more than jottings. Nothing systematic. But I miss it. I miss the feeling of putting my thoughts into words, of sharing my ideas with the world. So I have decided to make a conscious effort to get back to writing.

But privately, I continued to write. I wrote in my journal, in my notebooks, on my computer. I wrote about my thoughts, my feelings, my experiences. I wrote about the things that mattered to me, the things that kept me up at night. I wrote about my hopes and dreams, my fears and insecurities. I wrote about the world around me, the people I met, the places I visited. I wrote about everything and nothing, just to keep the words flowing.

Ultimately, I always wrote for myself. I never cared much about who read my work or what they thought of it. It's nice for people to care, but that's not necessary. I wrote because it helped me make sense of the world, because it gave me a way to express myself. And I want to get back to that place. Publicly.
